📌 Machine Learning Practice Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Practice Repository, where I document my journey of learning ML concepts through hands-on projects. This repository includes classification and regression models, custom datasets, and Automated EDA techniques to explore datasets efficiently. It is designed for beginners and intermediates who want to practice ML with well-structured code and explanations.

📂 Datasets Used

✅ California Housing Dataset (Regression) – Predict house prices based on various features.

✅ Iris Dataset (Classification) – Classify flowers into different species based on their attributes.

✅ Custom CSV Files – Additional datasets for practicing different ML techniques.

🚀 What's Inside? 🔹 Python scripts (.py files) with machine learning models built in VS Code.

🔹 Two Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for additional exploration.

🔹 Preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for better understanding.

🔹 Automated EDA Folder 📊 – Perform quick dataset analysis using Python.

🔹 Custom datasets to experiment with different ML problems.

🔹 Code with comments to help beginners follow along easily.
